## Data 
The data used is a music, represented by a sequence of discrete observations modeled with a Hidden Markov Chain (HMM) with time evolving parameters. A dirichlet prior is put on the parameters.

## Sampling
The sampling is done with a Gibbs Block Sampler. 

## Model inference
Music segmentation using the HMM model compared to a music-theoretic analysis.
